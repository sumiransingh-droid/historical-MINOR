                <p class="card-text">The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of
                  his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara
                  Begum. Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding
                  buildings and garden were finished five years later. The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief
                  after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.

                  commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from
                  Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who
                  also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan,
                  and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.</p>
